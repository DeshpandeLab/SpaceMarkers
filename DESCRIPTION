Description: Spatial transcriptomic technologies have helped to resolve the connection
            between gene expression and the 2D orientation of tissues relative to each other.
            However, the limited single-cell resolution makes it difficult to highlight the most 
            important molecular interactions in these tissues. SpaceMarkers, R/Bioconductor software,
            can help to find molecular interactions, by identifying genes associated with latent space 
            interactions in spatial transcriptomics.
