\title{Compute multi-sample overlap scores}
\usage{
get_multi_sample_overlaps(
  pat_hotspots_list,
  in_hotspots_list = NULL,
  patternList = NULL,
  method = c("Szymkiewicz-Simpson", "Jaccard", "Sorensen-Dice", "Ochiai", "absolute")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pat_hotspots_list}{Named list of hotspot tables for each sample.}

\item{in_hotspots_list}{Optional named list of influence hotspot tables
for each sample. If NULL, only pat_hotspots_list is used.}

\item{patternList}{Optional character vector of pattern names to include.}

\item{method}{Character. Overlap metric to use. One of
"Szymkiewicz-Simpson", "Jaccard", "Sorensen-Dice", "Ochiai", or "absolute".}
}
\value{
A list with two data.frames:
\describe{
\item{long}{Long-format table with one row per dataset and interaction.}
\item{wide}{Wide-format table with interactions as rows and datasets as columns.}
}
}
\description{
Compute pairwise overlap scores per sample and assemble long and wide
summaries across samples.
