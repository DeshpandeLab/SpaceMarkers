\usage{
getOverlapScores(
  hotspots,
  in_hotspots = NULL,
  pat_hotspots = NULL,
  patternList = NULL,
  method = c("Szymkiewicz-Simpson", "Jaccard", "Sorensen-Dice", "Ochiai", "absolute")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hotspots}{A data frame with columns x, y, barcode and pattern names}

\item{in_hotspots}{Hotspots from the influence of patterns, Default: NULL}

\item{pat_hotspots}{Hotspots from the pattern itself, Default: NULL}

\item{patternList}{A character vector of pattern names to calculate overlap
scores for}

\item{method}{The method to calculate overlap scores. Options are
"Szymkiewicz-Simpson", "Jaccard", "Sorensen-Dice", "Ochiai" and "absolute"}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns pattern1, pattern2 and overlapScore
}
\description{
Calculate the overlap scores between patterns in hotspots
}
\details{
The function calculates the overlap scores between patterns hotspots
using the specified method. The default method is "Szymkiewicz-Simpson"
overlap coefficient.
