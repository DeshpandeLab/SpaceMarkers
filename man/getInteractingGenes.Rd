Calculate Interaction Regions and Associated Genes}
\usage{
getInteractingGenes(
  data,
  reconstruction = NULL,
  spatialPatterns,
  optParams = NULL,
  refPattern = "Pattern_1",
  mode = c("residual", "DE"),
  minOverlap = 50,
  hotspotRegions = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{original spatial data matrix.}

\item{reconstruction}{reconstruction of the data matrix from latent spaces.
Required for "residual" mode.}

\item{spatialPatterns}{A data frame that contains the spatial coordinates for each cell type. The column names must include 'x' and 'y' as well as a set of numbered columns named 'Pattern_1.....N'.}

\item{optParams}{a matrix with dimensions 2 X N, where N is the number of patterns with optimal parameters for outlier
detection calculated from function getSpatialParameters(). The first row contains the kernel width sigmaOpt for each
pattern, and the second row is the threshOpt (outlier threshold) for each pattern. Users can also input their
preferred param values.
The default value is NULL.}

\item{refPattern}{a character string that specifies the pattern whose "interaction" with every other pattern we want
to study. The default value is "Pattern_1".}

\item{mode}{SpaceMarkers mode of operation. Possible values are "residual" (the default) or "DE".}

\item{minOverlap}{a number that specifies the minimum overlap between genes in two patterns to be considered for the statistical tests. The default is 50.}

\item{hotspotRegions}{a vector that specifies the patterns to compare to the 'refPattern'. The default is NULL which indicates that all patterns would be compared to the 'refPattern'.}
}
\value{
a list of data frames with information about the interacting genes of the refPattern and each latent feature pattern matrix (interacting_genes object). There is also a data frame with all of the regions of influence for any two of patterns (the hotspotRegions object).
}
\description{
This function calculates statistically significant genes using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for genes in any one region of influence and a post hoc Dunn's test is used for analysis of genes between regions.
