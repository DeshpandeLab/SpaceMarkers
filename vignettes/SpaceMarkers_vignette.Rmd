## Overview

SpaceMarkers leverages latent feature analysis of the spatial components of 
transcriptomic data to identify biologically relevant molecular interactions 
between cell groups.This tutorial will use the latent features from CoGAPS to 
look at pattern interactions in a Visium 10x breast ductal carcinoma spatial 
transcriptomics dataset.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("FertigLab/SpaceMarkers",dependencies=TRUE,
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Importing Libraries

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(SpaceMarkers)
```

## Obtaining and Formatting the Data

The data that will be used to demonstrate SpaceMarkers' capabilities is a human
breast cancer spatial transcriptomics dataset that comes from Visium.The CoGAPS
patterns as seen in the manuscript 
[Atul Deshpande et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2023.03.004) 
will also be taken from GitHub.

```{r}
main_10xlink <- "https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/spatial-exp/1.3.0"
counts_folder <- "Visium_Human_Breast_Cancer"
counts_file <- "Visium_Human_Breast_Cancer_filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5"
counts_url<-paste(c(main_10xlink,counts_folder,counts_file), collapse = "/")
sp_folder <- "Visium_FFPE_Human_Breast_Cancer"
sp_file <- "Visium_FFPE_Human_Breast_Cancer_spatial.tar.gz"
sp_url<-paste(c(main_10xlink,sp_folder,sp_file),collapse = "/")
```

## Removing Directories
The functions require that some files and directories with the same name be 
unique. Therefore any downloads from a previous run will be removed.
```{r}
unlink(sp_file)
files <- list.files(".")[grepl(counts_file,list.files("."))]
unlink(files)
unlink("spatial", recursive = TRUE)
```

### Extracting Counts Matrix

Here the counts matrix will be obtained from the h5 object in the Visium site 
and genes with less than 3 counts are removed from the dataset.

```{r}
download.file(counts_url,basename(counts_url))
counts_matrix <- load10XExpr(visiumDir = ".", h5filename = counts_file)
good_gene_threshold <- 3
goodGenes <- rownames(counts_matrix)[
    apply(counts_matrix,1,function(x) sum(x>0)>=good_gene_threshold)]
counts_matrix <- counts_matrix[goodGenes,]
```

### Obtaining CoGAPS Patterns

In this example the latent features from CoGAPS will be used to identify 
overlapping genes with SpaceMarkers. Here the featureLoadings (cells) and 
samplePatterns (genes) for both the expression matrix and CoGAPS matrix need to 
match.

```{r}
data("cogaps_result")
features <- intersect(rownames(counts_matrix),rownames(
    slot(cogaps_result,"featureLoadings")))
barcodes <- intersect(colnames(counts_matrix),rownames(
    slot(cogaps_result,"sampleFactors")))
counts_matrix <- counts_matrix[features,barcodes]
cogaps_matrix<-slot(cogaps_result,"featureLoadings")[features,]%*%
    t(slot(cogaps_result,"sampleFactors")[barcodes,])
```
### Obtaining Spatial Coordinates

The spatial coordinates will also be pulled from Visium for this dataset. 
These are combined with the latent features to demonstrate how cells for each 
pattern interact in 2D space.

```{r}
download.file(sp_url, basename(sp_url))
untar(basename(sp_url))
spCoords <- load10XCoords(visiumDir = ".")
rownames(spCoords) <- spCoords$barcode
spCoords <- spCoords[barcodes,]
spPatterns <- cbind(spCoords,slot(cogaps_result,"sampleFactors")[barcodes,])
head(spPatterns)
```
For demonstration purposes we will look at two patterns; Pattern_1 (immune cell)
and Pattern_5 (invasive carcinoma lesion).
```{r}
spPatterns<-spPatterns[c("barcode","y","x","Pattern_1","Pattern_5")]
```

## Executing SpaceMarkers

### SpaceMarker Modes

SpaceMarkers can operate in 'residual'or 'DE' (DifferentialExpression) mode. 
In an ideal world the overlapping patterns identified by SpaceMarkers would be a
homogeneous population of cells and the relationship between them would be 
linear. However, due to confounding effects of variations in cell density and 
common cell types in any given region, this is not always true.

To account for these confounding effects, the 'residual' mode compares the 
feature interactions between the expression matrix and the reconstructed latent
space matrix. The features with the highest residual error are reported. 
The genes are then classified according to regions of overlapping vs exclusive 
influence. The default mode is 'residual' mode.

Suppose the feature (gene) information is not readily available and only the 
sample (cells) latent feature patterns with P-values are available? 
This is the advantage of 'DE' mode. Where residual mode assesses the non-linear 
effects that may arise from confounding variables, 'DE' mode assesses simple 
linear interactions between patterns directly from expression. DE mode also 
compares genes from regions of overlapping vs exclusive influence but does not 
consider residuals from the expression matrix as there is no matrix 
reconstruction with the latent feature matrix.

To demonstrate SpaceMarkers we will be looking at Pattern_1 from CoGAPS. 
Pattern_1 was identified as mainly an immune cell driven pattern. Pattern_1 is 
the default setting if no Pattern_n preference is given by the user.

### Residual Mode

SpaceMarkers identifies regions of influence using a gaussian kernel outlier 
based model. The reference pattern (Pattern_1 in this case) is used as the prior
for this model. SpaceMarkers then identifies where the regions of influence are 
interacting from each of the other patterns as well as where they are mutually 
exclusive.

getSpatialParameters: This function identifies the optimal width of the gaussian
distribution (sigmaOpt) as well as the outlier threshold around the set of spotsx
(thresOpt) for each pattern.These parameters minimize the spatial 
autocorrelation residuals of the spots in the regions of influence. 
This function can take a while so the file would be read in from the data folder
for this tutorial.

getSpatialParameters took approximately 5 minutes on a MacBook Pro Quad-Intel 
Core i5 processor with 16 GB of memory. Therefore we will load this data from
a prevuious run. The spPatterns object is the sole paramter for this function.

```{r}
data("optParams")
optParams
```

getInteractingGenes: This function identifies the regions of influence and 
interaction as well as the genes associated with these regions. A non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis test is used to identify statistically significant genes in any 
one region of influence without discerning which region is more significant. 
A post hoc Dunn's Test is used for analysis of genes between regions and can 
distinguish which of two regions is more significant. If 'residual' mode is 
selected the user must provide a reconstructed matrix from the latent feature
matrix. This is passed to the 'reconstruction' argument and can be left as NULL
for 'DE' mode. The 'data' parameter is the original expression matrix. 
The 'spPatterns' argument takes a matrix with the spatial coordinates of 
each cell as well as the patterns. The spatial coordinate columns must have the 
labels x and y.

getInteractingGenes also takes about 3 minutes on a MacBook Pro with an Intel 
Core i5 processor and 16 GB of memory.

```{r}
SpaceMarkers <- getInteractingGenes(data = counts_matrix,
                                    reconstruction = cogaps_matrix,
                                    optParams = optParams,
                                    spPatterns = spPatterns,
                                    refPattern = "Pattern_1",
                                    mode ="residual",analysis="overlap")
```

NB: When running getInteractingGenes some warnings may be generated. 
The warnings are due to the nature of the 'sparse' data being used. 
Comparing two cells from the two patterns with identical information is 
redundant as SpaceMarkers is identifying statistically different expression for
interactions exclusive to either of the two patterns and a region that is due 
to interaction between the given two patterns. Also, if there are too many 
zeros in the genes (rows) of those regions, the columns are dropped as there 
is nothing to compare in the Kruskal Wallis test.


```{r}
print(head(SpaceMarkers$interacting_genes[[1]]))
print(head(SpaceMarkers$hotspotRegions))
```

The output is a list of data frames with information about the interacting genes
of the refPattern and each pattern from the CoGAPS matrix 
(interacting_genes object). 
There is also a data frame with all of the regions of influence for any two of 
patterns (the hotspotRegions object).

For the 'interacting_genes' data frames, the first column is the list of genes 
and the second column says whether the statistical test were done vsPattern_1,
vsPattern_2 or vsBoth. The remaining columns are statistics
for the Kruskal-Wallis test and the post hoc Dunn's test.The SpaceMarkersMetric
column is a product of the Dunn's statistics and is used to rank the genes.

### DE Mode

As described previously 'DE' mode only requires the counts matrix and spatial 
patterns and not the reconstructed CoGAPS matrix. It identifies simpler 
molecular interactions between regions.

```{r}
SpaceMarkers_DE <- getInteractingGenes(
    data=counts_matrix,reconstruction=NULL,
    optParams = optParams,
    spPatterns = spPatterns,
    refPattern = "Pattern_1",
    mode="DE",analysis="overlap")
```
### Differences between Residual Mode and DE Mode


To highlight the differences between residual mode and DE mode, the interaction 
between Pattern_1 (immune cell) and Pattern_5 (invasive carcinoma lesion) will
be assessed. One of the first things to notice is the difference in the number 
of genes identified between the two modes.

```{r}
residual_p1_p5<-SpaceMarkers$interacting_genes[[1]]
DE_p1_p5<-SpaceMarkers_DE$interacting_genes[[1]]
```

```{r}
paste(
    "Residual mode identified",dim(residual_p1_p5)[1],
        "interacting genes,while DE mode identified",dim(DE_p1_p5)[1],
        "interacting genes",collapse = NULL)
```

DE mode identified more genes because it does not consider noise that may be 
associated with common cell types in the interacting regions while residual mode
considers these and other confounding variables by taking the residuals between 
the counts and reconstructed latent feature matrix. The next analysis will show
where the top genes rank in each mode's list if they are identified at all. 
A function was created that will take the top 20 genes of a reference list of 
genes and compare it to the entire list of a second list of genes. The return 
object is a data frame of the gene, the name of each list and the ranking of 
each gene as compared to the reference list. If there is no gene identified in 
the second list compared to the reference it is classified as NA.

```{r}

compare_genes <- function(ref_list, list2,ref_name = "mode1",
                            list2_name = "mode2", sub_slice = NULL){

    if (is.null(sub_slice)) {
        ref_rank <- seq(1,length(ref_list),1)
    } else {
        ref_rank <- which(ref_list %in% ref_list[sub_slice])
        ref_list <- ref_list[ref_rank]
    }

    list2_ref_rank <- which(list2 %in% ref_list)
    list2_ref_genes <- list2[which(list2 %in% ref_list)]
    ref_genes_only <- ref_list[ !ref_list  %in% list2_ref_genes ]
    mode1 <- data.frame("Gene" = ref_list,"Rank" = ref_rank,"mode"= ref_name)
    mode2 <- data.frame("Gene" = c(list2_ref_genes, ref_genes_only),"Rank" = c(
        list2_ref_rank,rep(NA,length(ref_genes_only))),"mode"= list2_name)
    mode1_mode2 <- merge(mode1, mode2, by = "Gene", all = TRUE) 
    mode1_mode2 <- mode1_mode2[order(mode1_mode2$Rank.x),]
    mode1_mode2 <- subset(mode1_mode2,select = c("Gene","Rank.x","Rank.y"))
    colnames(mode1_mode2) <- c("Gene",paste0(ref_name,"_Rank"),
                                paste0(list2_name,"_Rank"))
    return(mode1_mode2)
}
```

```{r}
res_to_DE <- compare_genes(head(residual_p1_p5$Gene,n=20),DE_p1_p5$Gene,
                            ref_name="residual",list2_name="DE" )
DE_to_res <- compare_genes(head(DE_p1_p5$Gene, n = 20),residual_p1_p5$Gene,
                            ref_name = "DE",list2_name = "residual" )
```

#### Comparing residual mode to DE mode

```{r}
res_to_DE
```

Here we identify the top 20 genes in 'residual' mode and their corresponding 
ranking in DE mode.C1QB and HLA-DRB1 are the only two genes identified in 
residual mode and not in DE mode. The other genes are ranked relatively high
in both residual and DE mode.

#### Comparing DE mode to residual mode

```{r}
DE_to_res
```

Recall that DE mode looks at the information encoded in the latent feature space
and does not filter out genes based on any confounders between the counts matrix
and latent feature matrix as is done in 'residual' mode. Therefore there are
more genes in DE mode not identified at all in residual mode. Furthermore, genes
such as SDS and CTSB are ranked high in DE mode but relatively low in residual
mode.

There is some agreement with interacting genes between the two methods but there
are also quite a few differences. Therefore, the selected mode can significantly
impact the downstream results and should be taken into consideration based on 
the specific biological question being answered and the data available.

## Types of Analyses

One new feature of the SpaceMarkers package is the type of analysis that can be
carried out, whether 'overlap' or 'enrichment' mode. The major difference 
between the two is that enrichment mode includes genes even if they did not 
pass the multi-test correction for the KW tet. These additional genes were 
included to enable a more statistically powerful pathway enrichment analysis 
and understand to a better extent the impact of genes involved each pathway. 
Changing analysis = 'enrichment' in the getInteractingGenes function will 
enable this. Pre-created objects will be used to compare the two in 
residual mode.

```{r}
data("residual_p1_p5_enrichment_genesOnly")
data("DE_p1_p5_enrichment_genesOnly")

```


### Residual Mode and DE Mode - Enrichment

The data frames for the Pattern_1 x Pattern_5 will be used to compare the 
results of the enrichment analyses

#### Comparing Enrichment Analyses


```{r}
enrich_res_to_de<-compare_genes(
    DE_p1_p5_enrichment_genesOnly,
    residual_p1_p5_enrichment_genesOnly,
    ref_name="DE_Enrich",list2_name = "res_Enrich")
enrich_res_to_de
```
The ranks differ alot more here because now genes that were not previously 
ranked are assigned a score.

```{r}
overlap_enrich_de<-compare_genes(
    DE_p1_p5_enrichment_genesOnly,
    DE_p1_p5$Gene,
    ref_name="DE_Enrich",
    list2_name="DE_Overlap")
overlap_enrich_de
```
The enrichment and overlap analysis are in great agreement for DE mode,
with only a few changes which are seen especially among genes lower in the 
ranking. However, this is not as much the case with the overlap and 
enrichment analyses in residual mode..

```{r}
overlap_enrich_res<-compare_genes(
    residual_p1_p5$Gene,
    residual_p1_p5_enrichment_genesOnly,
    ref_name ="res_overlap",list2_name="res_enrich")
overlap_enrich_res
```
Residual mode with the enrichment selection is now including genes that may
not have passed the Dunn's Test for between group variation.However, the
SpaceMarkersMetric considers the Dunn's test only, so many genes that could not
be ranked in overlap analysis will now have a score associated with them. 

## Comparing Patterns Spatially

The differences between the gene interactions of Pattern_1 (immune cell) and 
Pattern_5 (invasive carcinoma lesion) can be visualized in various ways to view 
both the magnitude and location of expression in space. In this analysis the top
2-3 genes in residual mode from Pattern_5 only vs Pattern_1, Pattern_1 only vs 
Pattern_5 and the interacting region vs both Pattern_1 and Pattern_5 will be
compared.


The following libraries are required to make the plots:

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Matrix)
library(rjson)
library(cowplot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(grid)
library(readbitmap)
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(viridis)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(ggplot2)
```

This first function below can visualize the locations of these patterns on a 
spatial grid. The code has been adopted from 10xgenomics

```{r}
#code from
#support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/rkit
geom_spatial <-  function(mapping = NULL,
    data = NULL,
    stat = "identity",
    position = "identity",
    na.rm = FALSE,
    show.legend = NA,
    inherit.aes = FALSE,...) {
    GeomCustom <- ggproto(
        "GeomCustom",
        Geom,
        setup_data = function(self, data, params) {
            data <- ggproto_parent(Geom, self)$setup_data(data, params)
            data
        },
        
        draw_group = function(data, panel_scales, coord) {
            vp <- grid::viewport(x=data$x, y=data$y)
            g <- grid::editGrob(data$grob[[1]], vp=vp)
            ggplot2:::ggname("geom_spatial", g)
        },
        
        required_aes = c("grob","x","y")
        
    )
    
    layer(geom = GeomCustom,mapping = mapping,data = data,stat = stat,position=
                position,show.legend = show.legend,inherit.aes =
                inherit.aes,params = list(na.rm = na.rm, ...)
    )
}
```

Some spatial information for the breast cancer dataset is required.

```{r}
sample_names <- c("BreastCancer")
image_paths <- c("spatial/tissue_lowres_image.png")
scalefactor_paths <- c("spatial/scalefactors_json.json")
tissue_paths <- c("spatial/tissue_positions_list.csv")

images_cl <- list()

for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    images_cl[[i]] <- read.bitmap(image_paths[i])
}

height <- list()

for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    height[[i]] <-  data.frame(height = nrow(images_cl[[i]]))
}

height <- bind_rows(height)

width <- list()

for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    width[[i]] <- data.frame(width = ncol(images_cl[[i]]))
}

width <- bind_rows(width)

grobs <- list()
for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    grobs[[i]]<-rasterGrob(images_cl[[i]],width=unit(1,"npc"),
                            height=unit(1,"npc"))
}

images_tibble <- tibble(sample=factor(sample_names), grob=grobs)
images_tibble$height <- height$height
images_tibble$width <- width$width


scales <- list()

for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    scales[[i]] <- rjson::fromJSON(file = scalefactor_paths[i])
}

```

It is also helpful to adjust spot position by scale factor and format some of 
the tissue information.

```{r}
bcs <- list()
for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    bcs[[i]] <- read.csv(tissue_paths[i],col.names=c(
        "barcode","tissue","row","col","imagerow","imagecol"), header = FALSE)
    bcs[[i]]$imagerow <- bcs[[i]]$imagerow * scales[[i]]$tissue_lowres_scalef
    # scale tissue coordinates for lowres image
    bcs[[i]]$imagecol <- bcs[[i]]$imagecol * scales[[i]]$tissue_lowres_scalef
    bcs[[i]]$tissue <- as.factor(bcs[[i]]$tissue)
    bcs[[i]]$height <- height$height[i]
    bcs[[i]]$width <- width$width[i]
}
names(bcs) <- sample_names
```

Adding umi per spot, total genes per spot and merging the data

```{r}
matrix <- list()
for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    matrix[[i]] <- as.data.frame(t(as.matrix(counts_matrix)))
}
umi_sum <- list()
for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    umi_sum[[i]] <- data.frame(barcode =  row.names(matrix[[i]]),
                                sum_umi = Matrix::rowSums(matrix[[i]]))
}
names(umi_sum) <- sample_names

umi_sum <- bind_rows(umi_sum, .id = "sample")
gene_sum <- list()

for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
    gene_sum[[i]] <- data.frame(barcode=row.names(
        matrix[[i]]),sum_gene=Matrix::rowSums(matrix[[i]] != 0))

}
names(gene_sum) <- sample_names
gene_sum <- bind_rows(gene_sum, .id = "sample")
bcs_merge <- bind_rows(bcs, .id = "sample")
bcs_merge <- merge(bcs_merge,umi_sum, by = c("barcode", "sample"))
bcs_merge <- merge(bcs_merge,gene_sum, by = c("barcode", "sample"))

```

Specifying a continuous scale and colors before plotting

```{r}
myPalette <- function(numLevels) {
    return(colorRampPalette(c("blue","yellow"))(numLevels))}
```

Extracting top 3 genes ...

```{r}
gene_list <- c()
interactions <- unique(residual_p1_p5$`Pattern_1 x Pattern_5`)
n_genes <- 3
for (g in 1:length(interactions)){
    df <- residual_p1_p5 %>% dplyr::filter(
        residual_p1_p5$`Pattern_1 x Pattern_5` == interactions[g] & abs(
        residual_p1_p5$Dunn.zP2_P1) > 1 )
    print(paste0("Top ",n_genes," genes for ",interactions[g]))
    print(df$Gene[1:n_genes])
    gene_list <- c(gene_list,df$Gene[1:n_genes])
}
```

Visualize expression spatially

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plots <- list()
# default size = 1.75, stroke = 0.5
for (g in gene_list){
    for (i in 1:length(sample_names)) {
        plots[[length(plots)+1]] <- bcs_merge %>%dplyr::filter(
            sample ==sample_names[i]) %>% bind_cols(as.data.table(
            matrix[i])[,g, with=FALSE]) %>% ggplot(aes_string(
                x='imagecol', y='imagerow', fill=g)) +geom_spatial(
                data=images_tibble[i,], aes(grob=grob), x=0.5, y=0.5)+
            geom_point(shape = 21, colour = "black", size = 1.1, stroke = 0.2)+

                                sample_names[i])+

                panel.grid.major=element_blank(),
                panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
                panel.background = element_blank(),
                axis.line = element_line(colour="black"),
                axis.text=element_blank(),axis.ticks = element_blank())
    }
}
```

This next block of code can visualize the genes for each pattern on box plots

```{r}

                    "Interacting",ifelse(!is.na(region),region,

### Interacting region (vsBoth)

This category compares the interacting region to both Pattern_1 and Pattern_5 
exclusively

Below there are box plots and spatial heatmaps to help visualize the expression
of individual genes across different patterns. The two main statistics used to 
help interpret the expression of genes across the patterns are the KW 
statistics/pvalue and the Dunn's test. In this context the null hypothesis of 
the KW test is that the expression of a given gene across all of the spots is 
equal. The post hoc Dunn's test identifies how statistically significant the 
difference in expression of the given gene is between two patterns. The Dunn's 
test considers the differences between specific patterns and the KW test 
considers differences across all of the spots without considering the specific
patterns.

#### Table of statistics

```{r}
head(residual_p1_p5 %>% dplyr::filter(
    residual_p1_p5$`Pattern_1 x Pattern_5` == "vsBoth"),n_genes)
```

#### Visualizations

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_grid(plotlist = list(plist[[1]],plots[[1]]))
plot_grid(plotlist = list(plist[[2]],plots[[2]]))
```

On the spatial heatmap, Pattern_1 takes up most of the top half of the spatial
heatmap, followed by the interacting region along the diagonal and finally 
Pattern_5 in the bottom left corner. APOC1 is expressed across all patterns but
is especially strong in the interacting pattern. IGHE is highly specific to the
interacting pattern. The Dunn.pval_1_Int is lower for IGHE compared to APOC1 
indicating more significance in the interacting region vs the other two regions.
However, the overall SpaceMarkersMetric for APOC1 is higher and so it is 
ranked higher than IGHE.


```{r}
plot_grid(plotlist = list(plist[[3]],plots[[3]]))
```

The spatial heatmap for IFI30 shows fairly high expression in multiple patterns
but especially in the interacting regions. This is reflected in the box plots 
as well with high expression in the interacting pattern vs the other 
two patterns.


### Pattern_1 Only vs Pattern_5 (including Pattern_5 in interacting region)

#### Table of statistics

```{r}
head(residual_p1_p5 %>% dplyr::filter(
    residual_p1_p5$`Pattern_1 x Pattern_5`=="vsPattern_5"),n_genes - 1)

```

#### Visualizations

```{r}
plot_grid(plotlist = list(plist[[4]],plots[[4]]))
plot_grid(plotlist = list(plist[[5]],plots[[5]]))
```

Unlike the previous three genes the KW pvalues and Dunn's pvalues are relatively
high so the distinction will not appear as pronounced. The ING1 gene shows
relatively high expression in Patterns_5 and the interacting pattern vsPattern_1
This demonstrates genes in a `Pattern_n X Pattern_n` can show up on the top of 
the list by this SpaceMarkersMetric as long as there is a significant 
difference regardless of the direction of the difference between the patterns.

### Pattern_5 Only vs Pattern_1

#### Table of statistics

```{r}
head(residual_p1_p5 %>% dplyr::filter(
    residual_p1_p5$`Pattern_1 x Pattern_5` == "vsPattern_1"),n_genes - 1 )
```

#### Visualizations

```{r}
plot_grid(plotlist = list(plist[[7]],plots[[7]]))
plot_grid(plotlist = list(plist[[8]],plots[[8]]))
```

In this comparison the box plots show high expression of TMEM147 in Pattern_5 
and the interacting region compared to Pattern_1. However, the prevalent
expression profile for RCN1 is harder to distinguish. Like the Pattern_1 Only
vs Pattern_5, the p-values here are relatively high indicating low statistical
significance.
